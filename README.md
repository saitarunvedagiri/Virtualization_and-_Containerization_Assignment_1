## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to set up and run a **multi-container application** using Docker and Docker Compose.  

- **Service 1 (PostgreSQL):** Initializes a `trips` table with seed data (`city`, `minutes`, `fare`).  
- **Service 2 (Python app):** Connects to the database, queries records, computes simple statistics, and outputs results.  

The Python app produces a **JSON summary** of:  
- Total number of trips  
- Average fare per city  
- Top N longest trips by duration  

Results are written to `out/summary.json` and also printed to the console.
